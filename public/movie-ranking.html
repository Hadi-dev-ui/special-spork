  Directed by one of my favourite directors known as Christopher Nolan. The
  story telling is peak and the characters are top tier, not to mention the
  character development of the MC. Its just Wow.
</p>
<h3>2.Pirates of the Carribbean</h3>
<p>Its just Peak Fiction.</p>
<h3>3.Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite Ghibli movies. The art style and the animation is so
  beautiful and captivating.
</p>
<h3>4.The Wind Rises</h3>
<p>Another favourite movie of mine by Ghibli Studio.</p>
<h3>5.Parasite</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite Korean movies. It won an oscar in 2019 and it deserves it.

  between both worlds
